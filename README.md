# Milestone-2-Project

Full MERN Stack deployed on Heroku for the Full Stack program at UNLV. 

Project was initially envisioned as a remodel of the Digital Skills site, incorporating CRUD-functional assets such as:
customizable flash cards/trivia games
searchable document database


Current version of the app is mostly Lorem Ipsum, but can be filled with content to work with any type of learning or educational site, such as a language guide or workplace tutorials.


Project has full CRUD functionality on lessons, with a fillable lesson form stub and searchable database via Mongo.

Project contains documentation and functionality for a customizable flashcard game system, including elements such as high scores and personal bests. 

App is rendered server-side with client folder containing css and components such as images or other assets. 



Further functionality aims to include more complex options and customizability for lessons, as well as full CRUD functionality on flashcards and games. Site could be further expanded to include a real database instead of seeded proxy, as well as database functionality for user login, password, and useful information.
